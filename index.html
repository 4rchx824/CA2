              Hello! My name is <em>Yan Hein Latt</em>, but you can call me <em>Archie</em>. I'm from the country of Myanmar! Where I have resided for most of my life until May 12th last year.  <br /><br />
    
              I am currently a Year 1 student at Singapore Polytechnic studying under the three-year <em>DIT (Diploma in Information Technology)</em> Course, prior to studying in SP, I was studying in MDIS for almost a year and for my IGCSEs which is essentially the international version of the local GCE 'O' Level program. I've had interests in IT since young, this was due to my constant interaction with websites, apps, video games and more. Hence, during my IGCSEs I specifically chose subjects related to the field of IT to improve my chances to get into Singapore Polytechnic. <br /><br />
  
              Upon graduation in 2025 from Singapore Polytechnic, given a good GPA; I intend to apply for NUS Computer Science, if not, I'll have no choice but to apply to an overseas university. <br /><br />
  
              I have had prior experiences in IT, during my IGCSEs, I had chosen to do <a href="https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-igcse-information-and-communication-technology-0417/" target="_blank">ICT</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-igcse-computer-science-0478/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a>. In ICT, basic website building skills were taught e.g., using HTML tables to build websites and basic CSS for looks. While, in Computer Science, we were taught to program in Python, which we then had to use to write a program for our IGCSE exam (can be found on my <a href="https://replit.com/@4rchx824" target="_blank">repl.it</a>). <br /><br />Furthermore, during my time in MDIS, I had to learn more HTML and CSS. I also had to learn C++ and web application development using ASP .NET, C# and some SQL. Some other IT related modules I managed to touch up on include: Database Systems, Computer Security, Network Technology, System Analysis and Design, Operating Systems and VMware.<br /><br />
  
  
              During my free time, I like to take pictures of scenaries and play video games, such as Valorant and more!<br /><br />

                    1. Ethics
                </h6>
                <br />
                I believe Ethics are important in life, I believe that being ethical allows me to oppose unethical actions and to be able to assess a situation well through a broader perspective and not my own. Hence, this allows me to be consistent in my beliefs and will defend them for the general good.

                        Ethics is knowing the difference between what you have a right to do and what is right to do.

                    2. Friendship
                </h6>
                <br />
                Friendships are important to me because it allows me to enjoy life in the company of likeminded people. It gives a sense of self-worth, acceptance and belonging. Friendships teach us to take care of the other person and share what we have to offer.
                <br /><br />

                    3. Financial Stability
                </h6>
                <br />
                Although money is important, it is also not the most important to me, which is why I have it as my last value. Money is merely a medium of exchange which is important nowadays in order to achieve own needs and dreams, however it is still not as important as friends and ethics. Money can't buy happiness and real friends.
